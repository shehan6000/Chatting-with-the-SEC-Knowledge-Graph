# Chatting-with-the-SEC-Knowledge-Graph
## Overview
The aim of this project is to leverage a Neo4j graph database integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to explore and query SEC-related data. This project allows users to interact with a knowledge graph containing SEC document information and address data using natural language queries. The integration of Neo4j with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 enables automatic Cypher query generation, making it easier for users to retrieve relevant information from the graph.
